# CordicvsTaylor-DataAnalysis
Algebraic functions, functions that are constructed using only a finite amount of algebraic operations are really easy to understand, as algebraic operation involves only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising to a fractional power. However, when it comes to transcendental functions, functions that cannot be constructed by a finite amount of algebraic operations, they are much harder to comprehend. Some examples of a transcendental function are Trigonometric functions, Inverse Trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions.

Fortunately, after the discovery of the CORDIC algorithm and Taylorâ€™s Series, mathematicians and scientists are able to calculate and approximate these transcendental functions. This helped them obtain a better understanding of these functions, unlocking the unlimited potential of these functions.

For this project, I was able to developed programs for the CORDIC Algorithm and Taylor Series in Python to compute trigonometric values and utilize data analysis by collecting the output data of algorithms to compare its time complexity and deviation from its true value.
