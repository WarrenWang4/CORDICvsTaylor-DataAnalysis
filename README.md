# CordicvsTaylor-DataAnalysis
For this project, I developed programs for the CORDIC Algorithm and Taylor Series in Python to compute trigonometric values. Then, I analyzed and visualized collected output data of both algorithms to compare its time complexity and deviation from its true value. 

Open the Jupyter Notebook for more information, data visualization, and conclusion.
